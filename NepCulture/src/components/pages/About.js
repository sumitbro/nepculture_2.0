                            We aim to preserve, collect, exhibit Nepali
                            arts and artistic practices, and to educate visitors of Nepali artistic
                            leading to an understanding, appreciation and the promotion of our artistic
                            heritage in Nepal and then in the world. Nepali art is a reflection of the
                            country’s culture and soul, with an artistic history spanning over two
                            millennia. The site contains a collection of Nepali art that covers both
                            its religious traditions and more recent secular manifestations. Through
                            our website, everybody can explore the historic and cultural influences
                            on Nepali art practices to encourage a better understanding,
                            appreciation and promotion of Nepali art and artists.

                            Most great works of Nepali art have been denied a
                            wider audience, being housed in private collections
                            or as a part of limited exhibitions in Nepal and abroad.
                            NepCulture breaks this barrier, presenting masterpieces to a
                            wider and all-inclusive public.

                        Traditional and contemporary art balance each other.
                        The first, mirroring faiths and traditions, where the
                        foundations of our culture and way of life were embedded.
                        The second, representing today’s philosophies, anxieties and dogmas.

                        Art is in a rapid whirlpool of evolution,
                        revolution and experimentation. The modern
                        era of digital influences and mass accessibility
                        endangers individual expression, reduces artistic
                        variances and thus makes our society somewhat monotonic.

                        NepCulture was envisioned to give a prominent stage to Nepali artists,
                        to showcase their expressions and geniuses. This platform intends to
                        strengthen traditions, better understand our history, and pass this
                        knowledge on to future generations, while introducing our
                        non-comparative artistic forte, nepali culture and tradition to the world.

                        Additionally,
                        and more importantly, to exhibit these artistic marvels
                        to the general public, so that such knowledge and skill
                        would not be diminished in this world of chaos and singularity.
